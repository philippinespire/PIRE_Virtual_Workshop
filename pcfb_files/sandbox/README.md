# The Sandbox 

The purpose of this repository is for PIRE Virtual Workshop participants to create a sub directory labeled using their last name an underscore and first initial, for example Ivan Lopez would create the directory Lopez_I.  Participants will store exercise files in the sandbox so facilitators may evaluate them.  Thank you.
